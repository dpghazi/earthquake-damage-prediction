# Machine Learning Models for Nepal Earthquake Damage

## Project Description
In this project, I work with data from [Open Data Nepal](https://opendatanepal.com) to build machine learning models to predict building damage from the [Nepal 2015 Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake). I work primarily with data from the Gorkha and Kavrepalanchok districts.

### Overview
* Get data by querying a SQL database
* Build a logistic regression models for classification
* Build a decision tree models for classification
* Improve models by tuning their hyperparameters

### Tools & Libraries
* Python
* SQL
* Jupyter
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
